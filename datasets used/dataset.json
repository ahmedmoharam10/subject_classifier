Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance can lead to overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well, including the noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. The bias-variance tradeoff is a central concept in machine learning, as it represents the balance between fitting the training data with a simplified model, while variance represents the sensitivity of the model to variations in the training data. Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for building a well-performing model.",
